## Deploy

- Ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed.
- Generate a password hash for users in Authelia:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm authelia/authelia:latest \
    authelia crypto hash generate argon2 \
    --password 'my-password'
    ```
- Update the Authelia users configuration in [./config/users_database.yml](./config/users_database.yml):
    ```yaml
    users:
      your-user-name:
        disabled: false
        displayname: "User Name"
        password: "<generated-password-hash>"
        email: "root@localhost"
    ```
- Obtain your DuckDNS token and export the following environmental variables:
    ```bash
    export MY_PROVIDER="duckdns"
    export MY_DOMAIN=""
    export DUCKDNS_TOKEN=""

    docker-compose up -d
    ```
- Once the stack is up and running, go to your domain (`${MY_DOMAIN}`), log in with your password, and click register as shown below:

- Retrieve the first 2FA code from `config/notification.txt`.

  **NOTE:** This `config/notification.txt` is automatically created by Authelia. For example:
    ```bash
    cat config/notification.txt
